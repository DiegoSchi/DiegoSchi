### Hi there 👋

I'm Milly, a software engineer with experience in Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, MySQL and more. I've been working professionally for about 2 years but got my start back in days of MySpace and LiveJournal. I am enthusiastic about solving problems and enjoy the challenge of creating clean, structured and reusable code. Outside of my full time work my goal is to increase diversity in technology and help the next generation get their start. I volunteer with Code Nation teaching public high school students in NYC the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript and more! I am passionate about accessibility and committed to a web that works for everyone.
